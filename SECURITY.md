# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes apply to the latest commit on the `main` branch of this repository and the corresponding published Roblox place synced via Rojo.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not** open public GitHub issues for exploitable security bugs.

1. Contact the repository owner privately (GitHub security advisory or direct message if you have a channel).
2. Include steps to reproduce, impact, and affected scripts/remotes if known.
3. Allow reasonable time to patch before public disclosure.

**Never** paste API keys, DataStore dumps, or player PII in reports.

## Scope

In scope:

- Server remote validation bypasses (inventory, economy, LLM abuse, monetization)
- Secret leakage in git or published place
- Client-trusted gameplay state that affects other players

Out of scope:

- Social engineering of the experience owner
- Issues in Roblox platform itself (report to Roblox)
- Placeholder DevProduct IDs in a pre-release branch (tracked by `check-publish-readiness.mjs`)

## Secure development

- Run `npm run validate` before merging to `main`
- Keep LLM API keys in Studio `ServerStorage` only — see [`docs/git-security.md`](docs/git-security.md)
- Review [`docs/security-audit.md`](docs/security-audit.md) for applied hardening

## Recognition

We appreciate responsible disclosure. Contributors may be credited in release notes by agreement.
